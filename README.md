# CodeClan Final project

## Given by CodeClan

## Do whatever you want
Consolidate and expand your learning by taking on a project of your choosing.
### If you are stuck for inspiration, here are some ideas:
	•	Mobile dev (deeper into Android, Xamarin, React Native, Swift...)
	•	JavaScript frameworks (deeper into React, Angular, Vue, Marko, TypeScript...)
	•	Other languages (Go, Scala, C#, Python...)
	•	Other frameworks (Rails (Ruby), Django (Python), Laravel/Symfony (PHP), .NET/Unity (C#), Swing/JavaFX/Web apps (Java)...)
	•	Other random stuff (Firebase, Progressive Web Apps, AMP, Machine learning...)
With only one week, we do not expect it to be finished. Make the most of the time you have left with the expertise of your instructors and fellow developers in the class.
Submit an MVP and initial planning to the instructors by Friday afternoon. Present to us where you're at next Thursday. Teach us all something new
